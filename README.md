# Yuima-ru-Christian-Church
A Website for Yuima-ru Christian Church in Ishikawa, Okinawa

# Bugs / Issues:
- About section is overlapping with home/landing page in smaller viewport
- Start your journey tab blur comes in after the translation. Either remove or change the background.
  
## Current Ideas:
- Formatting could be: Home -> About -> Our Staff -> Schedule / Calender -> Location
- Replace the listen to what christ has for you with Our staff section (idea)
- Calender we have two choices, Typical Calender style with dates or have a list of dates for simplicity. (Talk to Ken-chan)
- Contact section could be completely changed to have the contacts at the bottom instead of buttons/links.
- Add Offerings page/route later but this might be after conversion.
- Add History of the church page/route
